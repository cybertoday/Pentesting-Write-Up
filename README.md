# Pentesting-Write-Up
In this write-up, we explore the hands-on pentesting and offensive techniques employed by my university cybersecurity club. These activities were conducted to simulate real-world attacks, identify vulnerabilities, and enhance the club members' practical understanding of cybersecurity. Our club aimed to contribute to our university's overall security posture while gaining valuable experience in offensive security practices.
